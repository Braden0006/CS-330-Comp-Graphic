## How do I approach designing software? 
* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
* What design process did you follow for your project work?
* How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
<br>
One design skill that helped me craft and get better at is close attention to detail between the reference image and implementation. I was really careful on the positioning and size of the objects in the scene and tried hard to make them as close to possible as the positions in the reference image. I followed a waterfall-type design process by incrementally creating the objects from largest to smallest. This helped tremendously with getting the positioning and size of the objects accurate. This same tactic could be applied to any type of future work by focusing on one task at a time and breaking it down until it's complete.

## How do I approach developing programs?
* What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
* How did iteration factor into your development?
* How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
<br>
One new development strategy that I used was incrementally changing and testing the code very often. This is crucial for this type of project because one small change can completely break the code, and if this small change happens in a 50-line code change then it can be difficult to debug it. As I mentioned before, iteration played a big role in the development of this project. Every little change was considered an iteration; Therefore, it was tested to make sure that it worked. My approach to developing the code pretty much stayed the same throughout the project. I was very careful whenever I made a change and thoroughly tested it to make sure that it didn't break the program.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
<br>
Computational graphics and visualizations helped me greatly develop my skill of attention to detail. This skill is crucial to programming and will do nothing but benefit me throughout my career. I don't think anything directly about computational graphics and visualizations will have a direct impact on my future educational and professional pathway because my focus is going to be on software engineering in other areas than computational graphics.
